# Project 2: Contact manager

 * L1: I want to view my saved contacts.
 * L2: I want to add new contacts.
 * L2: I want to search for contacts.
 * L3: I want to edit and remove existing contacts.

 Tips:
 * Make a backup of the existing `p2_data.csv` file.
 * CSV files contain records and fields:
   Each line is a "record" which contain "fields" of information.
   The fields are separated by commas. If a field is not provided,
   then there is no data for that particular field. There will
   always be a comma for the field even if no data is present.
 * The `id` and `name` fields are required, the `email` field is optional.
 * Check the documentation on the `java.io.FileReader` struct for reading
   and writing files.
 * Use the `split` function from the standard library to extract
   specific fields.
 * Create your program starting at level 1. Once finished, advance
   to the next level.
 * Make your program robust: there are 7 errors & multiple blank lines
   present in the data.
 * write again a console application in main a loop for the menu and a hashmap. 
   Create a help_fn class for all functions for a better overview
